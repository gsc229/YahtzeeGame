# YahtzeeGame
I'm creating a Yahtzee game with javascript
I have an intermediate knowledge of javascript.  Writing the code for a Yahtzee game 
is a challenge I've given myself. I'm pretty sure that the existing code
in the early version is 'spaghetti' code, but I figure, heck, I'll give it a try and
maybe something will stick. No pun intended.  

Once I have a better grasp of objects and react.js, I hope to refactor the code into
something more efficient.  But for now, it acually works!
