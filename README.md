# YahtzeeGame
I have an intermediate knowledge of javascript.  Writing the code for a Yahtzee game 
is a challenge I've given myself. I'm pretty sure that the existing code
in the early version is 'spaghetti code', but I figure, heck, I'll throw it at the wall and
maybe something will stick (pun intended).  

Once I have a better grasp of objects and react.js, I hope to refactor the code into
something more efficient.  But for now, it acually works!

The app.4.js file is the most current version.  As you can probably see, I'm just getting my feet wet with the git vcs as well.
